# smartsheet-ai-assistant

smartersheet. the ai assistant that can automate all of your annoyingly difficult smartsheet tasks. 

ask it to sort a column, to write a formula (yes, you can already do this in smartsheet, but might as well do it here too, right?),
to merge columns, to delete rows, to update data, to set automations, to create reports, and anything in between.

# setup

create .env file with ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and SMARTSHEET_API_KEY.

install all the dependencies in setup.py
