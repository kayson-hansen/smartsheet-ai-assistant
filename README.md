# smartsheet-ai-assistant

smartersheet. the ai assistant that can automate all of your annoyingly difficult smartsheet tasks. 

smartersheet is a chrome extension that adds an ai copilot to your smartsheet, supercharging the productivity
of project managers. think of it like stack overflow, but more often correct, more relevant, and more
convenient.

ask it to sort a column, to write a formula (yes, you can already do this in smartsheet, but might as well do it here too, right?),
to merge columns, to delete rows, to update data, to set automations, to create reports, and anything in between.
