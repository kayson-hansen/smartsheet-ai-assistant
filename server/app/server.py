"""Example LangChain server exposes and agent that has conversation history.

In this example, the history is stored entirely on the client's side.

Please see other examples in LangServe on how to use RunnableWithHistory to
store history on the server side.

Relevant LangChain documentation:

* Creating a custom agent: https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/how_to/custom_agent
* Streaming with agents: https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/how_to/streaming#custom-streaming-with-events
* General streaming documentation: https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/streaming
* Message History: https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/how_to/message_history

**ATTENTION**
1. To support streaming individual tokens you will need to use the astream events
   endpoint rather than the streaming endpoint.
2. This example does not truncate message history, so it will crash if you
   send too many messages (exceed token length).
3. The playground at the moment does not render agent output well! If you want to
   use the playground you need to customize it's output server side using astream
   events by wrapping it within another runnable.
4. See the client notebook it has an example of how to use stream_events client side!
